Phan Nguyen, Jacqueline Nguyen, Eric (Kyoungduk) Park, Matthew Park, Ilya Yurchenko

## Week 2

Nov 3rd ~ Nov 9th

## Accomplishment throughout the Week

As stated below, our weeks were full of quizzes and tests, so a lot of time were spent independently on getting familiar with the materials we need, and discussing the details via Messenger.
1. Learned Firebase API / Heroku / Node.js
2. (In Progress) Learning MIDI API.
3. Tested/Worked with MIDI and MIDI API at the Tufts electronic music lab.
4. Discussion about the logo design.
5. Discussion about the overall layout of each pages.
6. Discussion about new plug-ins and what plug-ins should actually be employed.

## Challenges and Issues

We couldn't find too much common time altogether, and thus worked separately at our own work stations. We decided that we will be collaboratively working together over the Thanksgiving week, since all of us will be at Tufts (sad..)

## Goals for the Week 3

1. Contact Dr. Paul Lehrman from the Tufts Music Department for help; he is the director of Music Engineering program at Tufts, and the Education Director of the MIDI Association. We're going to ask him for anyy available help from him regarding MIDI, and also ask if we could borrow few devices for the demo.
2. Start setting up Heroku / Database API's / Plug-in's.
3. Get ready for the Thanksgiving week, where we will be starting and putting all our materials together.
4. Code the sorting algorithm for our chart / database.
5. Start making sample musics to show up in our application.
