## Week 3

Nov 10th ~ Nov 16th

## Accomplishment throughout the Week

As per last week, we all have a lot of tests so most work was done independently. Discussions on project details were conducted over messenger. Most of this week was spent on discussing how we will break down the different implementation pieces and dividing up the work for Thanksgiving

1. Continued learning Firebase API / Heroku / Node.js. The entire team had a lot of exposure to Heroku/Node.js this week while working on our Assignment 3. We intend on making the server either some time this weekend or next week during Thanksgiving as a lot of us will be around. 
2. Continued learning MIDI API to see what data points/functions are accessible.
3. Tested/Worked with MIDI and MIDI API at the Tufts electronic music lab.
4. More discussion about the overall layout of each pages.
5. More discussion about new plug-ins and what plug-ins should actually be employed.

## Challenges and Issues

We all had Assignment 3 due this week so we didn't have time to meet as a group. Hence, we didn't actually have time to do a lot of implementation work. This shuold be resolved next week as we all spend Thanksgiving together coding in the basement of the Tufts Music Department :) 

## Goals for the Week 3

1. Set up and deploy Heroku/Node.js.
2. Fiddle with Firebase to make sure all data transactions work smoothly. 
3. Implement sorting algorithms and make charts/database
4. Start making sample musics to show up in our application.
